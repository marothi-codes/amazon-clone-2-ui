# Amazon Clone 2 User Interface Project

The React-Redux user interface for the full-stack version of the Amazon Clone Portfolio Project, unlike [the first one](https://github.com/marothi-codes/amazon-clone), I will not be using Firebase for the backend but rather a Node.js Express [REST API project](https://github.com/marothi-codes/amazon-clone-api) to flaunt some all-rounded clout at the corporate skeptics.

## What's the BIG IDEA Marothi?

- A good software/ web developer's philosophy is the "show them don't tell them approach" to (product execution and delivery) and "don't create high expectations, keep them low and over-deliver with value", creating room for exceeding those (seemingly-low) expections without being unrealistic with one's self while at it.

- This approach (stated above â¬†) is key to cultivating a **savage** reputation and being a benchmark without being a pointlessly cocky braggart with no substance to back up one's claims.

- I have no intentions talking a good game but having nothing to show for it but rather put in work and let the work do the speaking on my behalf.

## What are the ingrediends that go into this dish?

- React is the main star of the show with react-dom keeping the scaffold in check;
- Some Redux to bring some Cayenne Pepper "Zing" and keep application state in check;
- Redux DevTools Extensions to put application state under a good microscope to the nearest nanometer;
- Socket.io client to allow real-time chats with merchants as this is a multi-vendor ecommerce project;
- React google charts to show sales data visualisations to merchants in their dashboards;
- React Google Maps API to allow customers to visually input their shipping addresses into the application with minimal typing;
- Full CRUD operation support to allow merchants to manage their products and inventory conveniently;
- A full order history to allow users to keep their spending in check;
- Authentication and Authorisation for fine-grained access control for various user-account types i.e: _Merchants/ Vendors, Admins and Customers_.
- Profile Management to enable users to manage their account details thus keeping accounts up to date at all times.
