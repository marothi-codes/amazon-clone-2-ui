# Amazon Clone 2 User Interface Project

The React-Redux user interface for the full-stack version of the Amazon Clone Portfolio Project, unlike the first one, I will not be using Firbase for the backend but rather a Node.js Express REST API project to flaunt some all-rounded clout at the corporate skeptics.

## What's the BIG IDEA Marothi?

    - A good developer's philosophy is a "show me don't tell me" approach to flexing one's skills to onlookers.
    - I have no intentions talking a good game but having nothing to show for it but rather put in work and let the work do the speaking on my behalf.

## What are the ingrediends that go into this dish?

    - React is the main star of the show;
    - Some Redux pepper to bring some Cayenne Pepper "Zing" and keep application state in check;
    - Redux DevTools Extensions to put application state under a good microscope to the nanometer;
    - Some API magic to put the project on a production-level tier for the skeptics.
